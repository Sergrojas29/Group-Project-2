For this Porject we create a fictional Cafe. We create the database and the our own API for the cats and Some existing users. As wells as route using Handle Bars to make faster to render the html straight from the server side.
We had also implements create users and updated users but were not able to in the time to create a user interface for a user profile.



Description:
The web page allows users to sign up or login and then make reservations with a cat for our cat cafe. Users will also be see the lineup of the available cats and their various traits. Some examples include their breed, name, age, and even a catâ€™s affection styles; or ways they like to interact with customers. Users can see other important information by navigating the navbar such as our menu and rules. 
Admins of the cat cafe can go into the databases to update specific information for the cats at the cat cafe as well.
